#The Abysmal Plane

##Dimension

###Description

The Abysmal Plane is another dimension, equivalent in size to the Mundane universe. The plane follows magical laws of reality that are not
definable or measureable by Earth-level technology. This means that pretty much anything can happen there. 

The major difference between the Abysmal Plane and the Mundane plane is that the Abysmal is controlled/inhabited by the Abyssae. The 
Abyssae are uniformly ruled by negative emotions - hate, vengeance, terror, etc., and as such, their domains tend to reflect this. This is
not to say that all of the plane is 'bad'. There are some places where the inhabitants seem to be just and fair. However, due to the nature
of the dimension, the inhabitants will have unjustifiable quirks caused by a high background of negativity.

The Abysmal Plane is one of the places the souls of humans travel to after their deaths. These souls have a subconscious control over 
their environment. Sinners who believe they should bepunished for their transgressions, will cause themselves to be tormented for all 
eternity. The Abyssae actively promote this for their own amusement.

The travel value between Earth and the Abysmal Plane is normally 8. This can be dramatically improved if a sacrifice is performed by 
the traveler or summoner. Blood sacrifices of virgin humans reduces the travel value to 1. Dimensional shift affects this as normal.
